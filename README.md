# ⚡️ Pracky Downloader ⚡️  
> *Made with chaotic genius by Peace Ernest under the mighty Ernest Tech House banner*

## 🙅‍♂️ Disclaimer:
You can't use this code.  
Why? Because it’s **copyrighted AF**.  
So unless you're a wizard with 10 years of React AND written permission from the Code King himself (that’s me), you better just enjoy the magic from a distance.

## 🌐 Live Demo
Already running like a champ here:

Go ahead, test it. It slaps harder than grandma’s soup on a cold day.

## 🧠 What’s This Project Even About?

A universal video downloader made to flex on every other downloader on the block.  
Paste **any video link** (YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok—you name it), and BOOM:  
Clean, renamed, MP4 sauce ready for download.

**Facebook videos?**  
We rename every single one like a true boss:  
`Ernest_Tech_House_Facebook_Download.mp4`  
No fuss. No chaos. Just that smooth Ernest signature.

## 🐍 Backend Powered by Python

This masterpiece doesn't work alone—oh no.  
Behind every great React frontend is a backend doing the real dirty work.

This bad boy uses a **Python backend** that:
- Fetches and downloads your requested videos
- Renames them like a disciplined school teacher
- Sends them back to the frontend like a loyal pigeon

Yeah. We’re using Python because Python is that dude.

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

In the React project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Starts the frontend in dev mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to vibe with it.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Run it if you feel lucky.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production.  
Minifies your code like Marie Kondo on Red Bull.

### `npm run eject`
Use it when you're ready to break free from the Matrix.  
But beware—**you can't go back.**
